## DESCRIPTON : 

  Task 2: Weather App using Java Swing and REST API

### **Purpose of the Task**

The primary objective of Task 2 is to design and implement a **real-time Weather Application** using Java that fetches and displays current weather data based on a user-input city. This task emphasizes practical understanding of **Java GUI development**, **API integration**, **JSON data parsing**, and **real-world user interface design principles**. The aim is to allow users to interact with the app visually, request live data from a web service, and interpret the output in a readable, well-formatted manner.

This task not only strengthens foundational Java concepts but also introduces **event-driven programming**, **RESTful API consumption**, and **user experience design**. Additionally, features like dark mode and auto-refresh simulate production-ready capabilities that are expected in modern desktop applications.

### **Tools & Technologies Used**

- **Java 17+** – Core programming language.
- **Java Swing** – Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **REST API** – The OpenWeatherMap API was used for real-time weather data.
- **org.json** – A lightweight JSON library to parse API responses.
- **Timer (javax.swing.Timer)** – Used to implement auto-refreshing of weather data.
- **Eclipse STS (Spring Tool Suite)** – The IDE used to develop, test, and debug the application.

### **Features Implemented**

1. **Live Weather Fetching**:  
   Retrieves real-time weather data such as temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap’s REST API.

2. **User-Friendly GUI**:  
   Built using Java Swing, the interface includes input fields, buttons, and text areas styled for readability.

3. **Time Formatting**:  
   Converts the UNIX timestamp from the API into a human-readable, localized format.

4. **Country Flag Emoji**:  
   Dynamically displays a flag emoji based on the returned country code, enhancing the UI’s visual appeal.

5. **Dark Mode Toggle**:  
   The user can switch between light and dark themes using a checkbox, which adjusts the background and foreground colors of the entire UI for better comfort in low-light environments.

6. **Auto-Refresh**:  
   After the first weather fetch, the application automatically updates the weather data every 60 seconds using a Swing timer. This ensures users always view the most recent conditions without manually clicking.

7. **Error Handling**:  
   Alerts are provided when the city is not found or the API response fails, improving robustness and user communication.

### **Real-World Applications**

This type of application mimics the core functionality of real-world weather tools used in mobile and desktop platforms. Key use cases include:

- **Weather dashboards** for desktop-based weather stations.
- **Learning platform for beginners** integrating Java with web APIs.
- **Mini-projects for academic or internship portfolios**.
- Demonstrating knowledge of **RESTful APIs** and **desktop UI frameworks** during interviews or evaluations.

### **Conclusion**

Task 2 was designed to help transition from basic Java programming to a more application-oriented mindset. It required integrating front-end (Swing) and back-end (API & data processing) logic while maintaining code readability, functionality, and user interaction quality. By implementing extra features like dark mode and auto-refresh, the project has moved one step closer to a production-grade utility application. This task has significantly contributed to enhancing my understanding of **Java-based GUI development**, **API consumption**, and **UX-oriented design**, making it a standout project in my internship journey.
